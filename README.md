### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a physics PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working on building robust statistical inference pipelines for the [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/). I'm passionate about open software and the intersections of big data and particle astrophysics.
