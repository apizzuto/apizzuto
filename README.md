### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer and researcher at [Google Quantum AI](https://cloud.google.com/apigee](https://quantumai.google/), working on leveraging ML techniques to optimize parameters of Google's quantum computers. Before Google, I completed my PhD in particle astrophysics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison on the [IceCube Neutrino Observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/). I'm passionate about open software, big data, and statistical inference.
